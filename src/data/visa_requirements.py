NOTE: The US row's `advisory_level` and `advisory_summary` are also
overridden at request time by the latest TravelAdvisoryScraper row in
the database (see server.tool_visa_requirements). Keep this dict as
the static fallback in case the scraper hasn't run yet or returns
no result.

Update whenever you confirm a policy change. The tool's UI always
links the user back to the relevant embassy / state-department page.

# As of March 19, 2026 the US Department of State downgraded Venezuela
# from Level 4 ("Do Not Travel") to Level 3 ("Reconsider Travel"),
# removing the Wrongful Detention / Unrest / Other risk indicators
# while keeping Level 4 designations on specific border states. This
# is the static baseline; the live page also reads from the
# TravelAdvisoryScraper output and will reflect any further changes
# automatically.
